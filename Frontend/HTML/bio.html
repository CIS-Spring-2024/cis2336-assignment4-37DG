        <h3>
            The Voyager Hall is currently managed by owner Daniel Garza.
        </h3>
        <div id="about">
            <p>
                The Hall began as an idea on keeping students focused in class at the University of Houston - Sugar Land campus. While the cafeteria inside of 
                the Brazos building was suitable for an early or local student wanting lunch, anyone who might have just arrived on campus could be unable to eat 
                before their class starts.
            </p>
            <p>
                For example, students coming from the main campus would have to set aside 40+ minutes on their daily schedule, leaving less time to eat before classes 
                start. The hall was first made to support these "Voyagers" in their classes by removing the distraction that prolonged hunger brings.
            </p>
            <h3>
                Thus, Voyager Hall was born.
            </h3>
            <p>
                The Meals were later introduced due to Voyager Hall's increased popularity with students seeking something to eat before driving or shuttling home. To 
                this goal, we strive to create dishes that are filling, enjoyable, and relatively quick to prepare.
